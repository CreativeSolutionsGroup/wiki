To add allowed users, please paste all of the emails row by row into the *ALLOWED-USERS* subsheet.

It might list their first and last names, but do not worry about this. That's extra information for our use.

## Adding test users

To add test users, go to the bottom of *New Student Master List*. Add your first and last name, phone number, and ID. In *STING Groups* add a group called **STING_GROUP_TEST**. This will add an option to the dropdown in *New Student Master List* for the **STING Group ID** row. Please select this group. Feel free to add any phone numbers to the STING group that you would like to test.
