# Yellow Jacket Check In Start of Year Preperation

Yellow Jacket Check In works off of Google Sheets.

## Adding allowed users

To add allowed users, paste their emails row by row into the *ALLOWED-USERS* subsheet found at the bottom of the *[current year] GS - New Student Master List*, stored in the shared CE Drive. Do **not** delete the headers: *email, first_name, last_name*.

The columns *first_name* and *last_name* are optional - they provide additional information for CSG use. The *email* column, however, is **required**.

## Adding test users

To add test users, go to the bottom of *New Student Master List*. Add your first and last name, phone number, and ID. In *STING Groups* add a group called **STING_GROUP_TEST**. This will add an option to the dropdown in *New Student Master List* for the **STING Group ID** row. Please select this group. Feel free to add any phone numbers to the STING group that you would like to test.
