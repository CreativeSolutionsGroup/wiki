# Reporting

This is how you create a report using Tableau and Smart Events.

## Requirements

To do this, you must have access to the CSG email. This means that it will likely be delegated to execs.

## The Work Before the Work (The Real Step 1)

Here, we need to export data from Smart Events into the data source for Tableau.

1. On SE Admin Dashboard, scroll to the bottom and select your event.
2. Select "Get Report for Event"
3. Go to [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MnvnQCP7nCRaFSH5nir4aUzg6aATRVDshBpvh7jMpH8/edit#gid=1167158175) sheet.
3. Paste this data into ANOTHER blank Google Sheet and make the following columns:
- Timestamp (mm/dd/yyyy)
- Event (Name, basic string)
- ID (7 digit)
- Year (yyyy)
- Term (yyyyFA/SP - so, for example: 2023FA)

## How To

1. Go [here](https://sso.online.tableau.com/public/idp/SSO) and begin to log in with `creativesolutions@cedarville.edu`. This should bring you to the SSO page for tableau.
2. Go to [here](https://prod-useast-a.online.tableau.com/#/site/cedarvilleuniversity/workbooks/1094976/views) after you have logged in.
3. Select the event you want to export.
- If you want to export an entire month or semester, make sure to whittle that down with the top two options. Select "all" on events.
- Otherwise, select the individual event that you want.
5. Select the top right button to download a PDF.
6. Select on the prompt "Specific sheets from this workbook"
7. Select the last 6 pages.
8. Click "Download"
