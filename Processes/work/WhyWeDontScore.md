# Why CSG Does Not Score Stories

CSG does not score stories because [Scrum](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) does not score stories.

While that might be a nice one-liner, there's a fair bit more explanation than that.

Let's start off with this: ask yourself, *why* do you want to score stories? Is it to get a better grasp on the work that is happening during the Sprint? Is it so that you can understand the amount of work any single employee is doing? Let me encourage you: both of these are for naught and lead to either inefficiency or distrust in the organization.

## The Scope of Our Work

We have a *vast* scope of work at CSG. We go from embedded systems (such as SICK) to something as simple as STING Connect. In a normal organization, this would be split up in to many teams. Part of the importance of scoring stories is that everyone on the team is *able* to give an accurate score for the team. It is not the case on CSG.

Inaccurate data is worse than no data. If we start making the team do *extravagant* amounts of work just because a few people say that it's "easy," we have failed the team.

## The Difficulty of Reporting

Depending on the technology, generating reports is hard. As you will read below, GitHub's reporting is subpar on Projects. Basecamp doesn't even *have* reports, nor scoring. This is because Basecamp and Shape Up recognizes that scoring is arbitrary.

## The Difficulty of Story Sizes

This is primarily a tech problem, not really a process problem.

Any time that you associate a story size with a number, you're instantly going to try and associate it with hours. This goes against the philosophy of scoring in the first place. For instance, you may use T-Shirt sizes to score stores, instead of Fibbonacci. However, with GitHub, you cannot do weighted sums based on the "size" of a story. This means that whenever you generate a report, it does not provide meaningful data behind the size of the Sprint.
