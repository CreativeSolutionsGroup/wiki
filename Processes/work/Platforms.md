# Platforms

Here we document the various platforms that we use. It will be split into two sections. Alongside this split, it will also not be explaining the full extent of the technology. It will link to the documents that do talk about it.

## But first, a note.

Do not *ever* add a personal phone number as 2FA. Please add a FTT member's phone number. If you need to use 2FA for logging into an account, make sure that the FTT member is able to access it primarily. Then, most platforms will allow your personal or Cedarville email to be a tenant of that.

## Basecamp

Basecamp contains everything that we do at CSG from a meta perspective. It contains our work backlog and booper setup backlog. Please check out [this link](/Dev-Tools/basecamp/tool.md).

### HOW TO ACCESS?

To access this, you will be invited by the previous year's execs and receive an email.

## AWS

AWS contains all of the hosting for our many applications. To understand more about specific parts of AWS, please check out [this link](/Dev-Tools/aws/tool.md).

### HOW TO ACCESS?

Ask your exec for access. You usually should not have access to this unless
1. You are designated to be able to manage the deployments
2. You are an exec.

## Cloudflare

Cloudflare contains all of our hosting for serverless workers. 

### HOW TO ACCESS?

Ask your exec for access. It is also contained under the Creative Solutions email so you should be able to just log into Cloudflare under that.

## Github

Github *only* hosts our code. We do not do project management in it anymore. We also do pull requests in it. For more information, please check out [this link](/Dev-Tools/github/tool.md).

### HOW TO ACCESS?

Your execs will add you to the GitHub organization. If you are not on, please ask your exec ASAP.
