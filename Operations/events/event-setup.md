# Event Setup

CE Smart Events is a large part of what we do here at CSG. Being able to setup the events is an integral part of SE.

NOTE: If you have not, please read [this](#what-if-the-boopers-were-used-last-night-in-a-place-with-no-wifi).

## How To

1. Open [admin.cusmartevents.com](admin.cusmartevents.com) and login with your Cedarville email.
2. Create a new event in the second table.
3. Associate each client with an event by clicking on each client and changing their event to the relevant one.

You are now ready to physically set up the boopers!

It is likely that there is a diagram supplied by your higher ups for where to place the boopers. Please follow this diagram. All the boopers need are:

1. A client
2. A booper
3. WiFi (optional, but you will need to do [this](#what-if-the-boopers-were-used-last-night-in-a-place-with-no-wifi) afterwards.)
4. A-Frame for displaying that there is a checkin system here.

## What If...

#### What if the boopers were used last night in a place with no WiFi?

If so, DO NOT do any of the steps above! Instead:

1. Plug in each booper.
2. Wait for ~2 minutes.
3. Unplug the boopers.

This will drain all of the checkins that were not able to be registered in the moment.
