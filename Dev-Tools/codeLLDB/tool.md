CodeLLDB is a VSCode extension that allows for Debugging Rust applications.

## Installation

Search for `CodeLLDB` in the VSCode Extensions tab and install it.

When within the main file of a Rust application there should now be `Run | Debug` options over the main function. Just use either one to run the Rust program within VSCode.
