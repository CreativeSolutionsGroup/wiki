# Basecamp

[Home](../../Readme.md) / [Dev Tools](../dev-tools.md) / [Basecamp](tool.md)

This is our operational task board. It is used mainly by the execs and other teams. This will be used rarely by normal CSG team members. It is similar to GitHub in the way that it is a way of keeping track of tasks and their progress. You may log in to basecamp from the website at [3.basecamp.com](https://3.basecamp.com/) if you do not want the application.

## Installation

### Desktop

## How to use

### Home page

This is your best friend. What you will need most is found here. The first strip of cards is the projects that you are a part of. Clicking one will bring you to a project page. On the **bottom left**, you will find a calendar with any assignments that have a due date on them. On the **bottom right** you will find all assignments that are assigned to you. Your goal is to keep this as empty as possible. Clicking **See All** will show you all of your assignments on a separate page.

### Project page

<img src="./images/project-page.png" width=600px alt="project page"/>

On a project page you will see a few different options. Most commonly there is **to-dos**, **docs & files**, **schedule**, and then different boards. The picture includes **The Project Board** and **CSG Form Requests**. **To-dos** are a list of assignments that need done. **Docs & Files** are an easy place for storing files that are to be shared on cards. **Schedule** is a calendar of any assignments with due dates. At the bottom, you can see a timeline of all activity that has been done within the project.

### Project Boards

This page includes most of the assignments made for the project. In this example, we have 6 sections. **Ideation** for assignment not yet ready for working on yet. Kind of like a draft stage. **Icebox** is for any tasks that are ready for work but haven't been started yet. **For re-scheduling** is for tasks that may have been started, but need to wait or be scheduled again. Often for meeting tasks. **In Development** are any tasks that are being worked on in some capacity. **In Review** are for any tasks that are *done* by the assignee, but need to be looked at by a higher-up before being done. Finally, **done** is for those tasks that need no more work done on them.

### Creating a task / assignment / card

<img src="./images/create-card.png" width=300px alt="create a card"/>

Creating a task can be done easily. While inside a project board, click any of the ellipses inside a circle. Then select **Add card**. This will open a dialog where you can fill in the information about the task and save it.

### Assignments

<img src="./images/assignment.png" width=600px alt="create a card"/>

By clicking on any assignment you can open up that assignment page. This includes any information on the task, as well as any conversation around that task. You can change any of this information. Whenever work is done on an assignment there should be a message sent to inform anyone else working on it. To tag a specific person in a message, you can type `@` and then their name. This will also send them a notification.
