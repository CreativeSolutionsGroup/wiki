# Basecamp

[Home](../../Readme.md) / [Dev Tools](../dev-tools.md) / [Basecamp](tool.md)

This is our operational task board. It is used mainly by the execs and other teams. This will be used rarely by normal CSG team members. It is similar to GitHub in the way that it is a way of keeping track of tasks and their progress.

## Installation

### Desktop

There is no desktop application. You can find the website at [3.basecamp.com](https://3.basecamp.com/). From there you can sign in. You **can not** use SSO with Google and must sign in with an email. If your Cedarville email does not work for logging you in, please contact one of your execs.
