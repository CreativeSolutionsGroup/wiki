# Dayforce

[Home](../../Readme.md) / [Dev Tools](../dev-tools.md) / [Dayforce](tool.md)

This is the payroll system used by Cedarville University. It is how you clock in and out of your shifts and how HR will know who needs to be paid and how much. Remember that unless you are told otherwise, you are allotted 10 hours a week to work (this is a limit, not a requirement).

## Installation

We recommend installing Dayforce on mobile so you can feasibly clock in and out as you work. Go to your local Google Play (Android) or App Store (Apple) and type in `Dayforce`. Click 

### Mobile

1. Company code: `cedarville`
2. SSO with Cedarville credentials

## How to use

## FAQ

*How many hours should I work?*
> You are not required to put in any hours as a non-executive team member per week. You are, however, only alloted 10 hours per week, and 20 hours in a pay period (every 2 weeks). This may change if given direct orders from a CSG executive, Westin, or Brian.
