# Dayforce

[Home](../../Readme.md) / [Dev Tools](../dev-tools.md) / [Dayforce](tool.md)

This is the payroll application used by Cedarville University. It is how you clock in and out, and how HR will know who to pay and what amount. Remember that unless you are told otherwise, you are allotted 10 hours a week to work (this is a limit, not a requirement).

## Installation

We recommend installing Dayforce on mobile so you can feasibly clock in and out as you work. Go to your local Google Play (Android) or App Store (Apple) and type in `Dayforce`. The application will appear as so:

2. SSO (Single-Sign-On) with Cedarville credentials

## How to use



## FAQ

*How many hours should I work?*
> As a non-executive, you are not required to work a minimum number of hours per week. You are, however, allotted a maximum of 10 hours per week, and 20 hours a pay period (every 2 weeks). This may change if given direct orders from a CSG executive, Westin, or Brian.
> As a member of CSG, however, you are expected to attend the weekly Sprint Meeting. You may clock this (half-)hour.

*I can't log in. What should I do?*
> If you are a new-hire at Cedarville, HR has likely not finished filling or is missing some of the paperwork necessary to begin clocking hours. Email [cuhired@cedarville.edu](mailto:`cuhired@cedarville.edu`). 
> If this is a "random" occurence, try closing out of the app and re-opening it. Make sure you are using SSO.

*When will I be able to log my hours?*

*I forgot to log my time. What should I do?*

*Do I need to approve my hours?*

*How do I specify what job I work if I have multiple on-campus jobs?*
