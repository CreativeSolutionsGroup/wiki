# Google Forms ➡️ Basecamp

## Overview

This project started out as a simple idea that we could use the "onsubmit" action on a Google form to trigger an update in Basecamp that would create a card detailing what needed to be done. Originally Westin had the idea for a few forms that the team was manually transferring information from Forms to Basecamp for, but the project became more complex than that in the end.

We now have the capability to create both todo list items and cards on the card table, and will soon have a feature to allow the connector to assign people to a card by default.

## Creating Connectors

This is the part that everybody is excited about: actually making the form send the request to basecamp.

See [Creating a "Webhook"](./creating.md) for more details

## Technical Details

And this is the part that everybody dreads: documentation going on for miles about how the thing works. (Don't worry it really isn't that long...)
