### Microsoft Teams

This is a communication app that is used by Campus Experience as a whole. Any work communication should be done on teams. There are two applications, one for phone and one for computer. You will **not** be forced to install either application, but if you are working you must have access to Teams. If you do not want either application you need to be able to access the [teams website](https://teams.microsoft.com/go#).

#### Installation

##### Desktop

1. Download the installer from [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2187327&Lmsrc=groupChatMarketingPageWeb&Cmpid=directDownloadWin64&clcid=0x409&culture=en-us&country=us)
2. Run the installer
3. log in to your Cedarville account

##### Mobile

1. Download the Apple app or the Android App from [here](https://aka.ms/teamsmobiledownload) or scan the QR Code.
 
![Teams QR Code](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/image/microsoftcorp/qrcode-new?resMode=sharp2&op_usm=1.5,0.65,15,0&wid=180&hei=180&qlt=100&fit=constrain)

2. log in to your Cedarville account

#### How to use

As this is a messaging app it is going to be used differently by everyone. As a basic rule, you should have the two teams shown in the picture below.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1b-MPd-LGuG3iJ3N3YwtZb5O9OInGWbyV" alt="Teams needed teams" width="800px"/>

Any group-related messages will come through these two groups. Check them often if you ever want the chance at free donuts.

Most of the messaging that you will care about will be in the **Chat** tab. In this tab, you will be able to select specific people to message. This is best used for sub-groups or if you need to get ahold of a single person. Other than that the app works the same as a text messaging app, just for work purposes. Any work-related messages should be done on teams.

*Do I need to have Teams?*
> You will be required to have access to Teams at the lowest location (At least the website). Unless you are an exec, team members need not have access to Teams at all times. It is however, nice to be able to respond to a quick question, and we as execs on CSG, will not blow up your phone with nonsense messages.

### Basecamp

This is our operational task board. It is used mainly by the execs and other teams. This will be used rarely by normal CSG team members. It is similar to GitHub in the way that it is a way of keeping track of tasks and their progress.

#### Installation

#### FAQ

*Will I need this?*

### Dayforce

This is the payroll system that is used by Cedarville University. It is how you will clock in and out of your shifts and how HR will know who needs paid how much. Remember that unless you are told otherwise, you are alloted 10 hours a week for working.

#### Installation

#### How to use

#### FAQ

*How many hours should I work?*
> You are not required to put in any hours as a normal team member per week. You are however only alloted 10 hours per week, and 20 hours in a pay period. This may change if given direct orders from a CSG exec, Westin, or Brian.

*I can't log in. What should I do?*

*When will I be able to log my hours?*

*I forgot to log time. What should I do?*

*Do I need to approve my hours?*

*How do I specify what job I work if I have multiple on campus jobs?*

### Dayforce Wallet

This is required by HR for the first paycheck students receive as direct deposit. After, you will not be required to use this application, but can use it if you choose to do so. It works in the same way as a Debit card, and you will receive one upon signing up with the app.

#### Installation
